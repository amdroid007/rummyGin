<p>This exercise set requires the Lecture 25 code.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement Visitor support by putting the recursion back in the element hierarchy.</li>
<li>Reimplement PrintVisitor to also include the depth of the element in the structure. For example, a Faculty would be printed such as "1) Science" where 1 is the depth. Departments would be depth 2, and committee depth N (depending on their parent organization).<strong></strong></li>
<li>Reimplement the DefaultVisitor class so that it realizes full double-dispatch by calling the accept method on element nodes. Draw a sequence diagram for the beginning of a scenario involving passing the DefaultVisitor into the mcgill element graph.</li>
<li>Complete the Employee-Manager example, write a visitor for it, and try it out. Note that this is also Question 3 in the practice final.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Why is it not a good idea to call all the visit methods "visit(" and simply distinguish them based on parameters?</li>
</ol>
