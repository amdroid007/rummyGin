<p><strong>Recommended Completion Date</strong>: Before the end of classes.</p>
<p>By far the best way to use your time to practice the topics of lecture 19 and 20 is to work on your milestone 3. If you want to get started with a few small tasks, you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement small GUI programs using the 3 different ways to implement Listeners presented in class.</li>
<li>Implement a small GUI program with an action listener that loops 1000000 times doing something mindless (e.g., adding numbers - or even worse: printing stuff to the console).</li>
<li>Draw a class and object diagram for the Clicker program.</li>
<li>Draw/complete class and object diagrams modeling the three different versions of the PokerHandGenerator program.</li>
</ol>
<p>To help you get started, you can also study the GUI programs provided in the lecture notes, draw UML diagrams that capture their main ideas, and try to reimplement them by yourself just from the diagrams.</p>
