<p><strong>Recommended Completion Date</strong>: Before midterm 2</p>
<p>The topics covered in Lecture 15 and 16 are best practiced directly by working on your project. In doing so, ensure that you have practiced at least the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing code to throw and catch exceptions.</li>
<li>Writing finally blocks.</li>
<li>Using polymorphism in catch clauses and your own user-defined exceptions to cleanly organize exception flow.</li>
<li>Used the compiler checks and the FindBugs tool to seek and destroy actual bugs. If your code happens to be 100% bug free, you can use the tools on jEdit to gain practical experience.</li>
<li>Wrote annotations for inter-procedural analysis and used to resulting messages to improve your code.</li>
<li>Used the Checkstyle Metrics rules to discover places in your code that have high coupling or branching complexity (and hopefully improve them).</li>
<li>Implemented at least the following refactorings in your code: Introduce Parameter Object, Hide Delegate, Replace Data Value with Object, and Extract Interface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the architecture of the project, you should find opportunities to experiment with all these in your project code. If not, you can always practice on the code in the lecture slides. Note that Eclipse has automated support for two of the four required refactorings (which ones?), but you should also be able to do it manually. Note also that if after a refactoring you are not happy with the resulting design, you can revert using the revision control system.</p>
