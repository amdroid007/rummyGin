<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get unlimited access to TaskNav for the duration of the term, follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill in the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=139645&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=McG-526503" target="_self">entrance survey</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to participate in the study, read, print, and sign the c<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=139645&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=McG-526485" target="_self">onsent form</a>. Then take a picture or scan of page 2. If you choose to participate, thank you.</li>
<li>Email christoph.treude@mail.mcgill.ca the survey and (if applicable) the consent form. The information will be kept in confidentiality by Dr. Treude until the final COMP 303 grades have been submitted.</li>
<li>You will shortly thereafter receive your account information. By using TaskNav you agree <strong>not</strong> to share your account.</li>
<li>Got to <a href="http://tasknav.cs.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">http://tasknav.cs.mcgill.ca</a> and search away!</li>
</ol>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>At first, only the "normal" text-search feature will be activated. This will be part of a warm-up phase to let you get used to the tool. Once a sufficient number of queries have been received, we will enable the powerful auto-complete and task-based querying features.</p>
<h2>If you have problems</h2>
<p>For general questions, you can post a message to the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=139645&amp;type=discuss&amp;rcode=McG-526502" target="_self">TaskNav </a>forum.</p>
<p>If you think you found a problem with TaskNav, go to&nbsp;<a href="http://bugzilla.cs.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">our bugzilla database</a> and file a bug report (you will need to create an account if you don't have one). This will also give you real-life experience with bug reporting. Don't forget to read the bug authoring guidelines and make sure your bug has not already been reported. The text above the bug-reporting form will point you to some instructions.</p>
