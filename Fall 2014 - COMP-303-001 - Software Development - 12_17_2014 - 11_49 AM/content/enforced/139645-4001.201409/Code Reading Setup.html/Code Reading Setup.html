<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>We will be using three open-source projects as sample code bases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jhotdraw/" target="_blank">JHotDraw 5.3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jedit.org/" target="_blank">jEdit 4.5.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino" target="_blank">Rhino 1.7 R4</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Download and installation</h2>
<p>You need to import these codebases into an Eclipse Luna workspace to be able to do the assignments exactly as described. For the more adventurous, you can pull the code directly into Eclipse by finding the source information on each project page, checking out the release, and fiddling around a bit to get the code to properly build into Eclipse. Each project uses a different version control system (CVS, SVN, and Git, respectively). This can require some patience...</p>
<p>For those who prefer a more seamless solution, I've prepared a sanitized version of each code base, ready for import. Download the three codebase zip files on your computer, then, in Eclipse, do File | Import | (General) Existing Projects into Workspace, and go through the motions. The code bases should build automatically.</p>
<h2>Running the Applications</h2>
<p>Right-click a project and select Run As | Java Application. Pick the appropriate main type:</p>
<ul>
<li>JHotDraw -&gt; JavaDrawApp</li>
<li>jEdit -&gt; jEdit</li>
<li>Rhino -&gt; ...tools.shell.Main</li>
</ul>
<h2>Surfing the Code</h2>
<p>Understanding source code requires quickly navigating between different locations. For this, it pays to be familiar with the powerful code navigation features of IDEs like Eclipse. Make sure you learn to use <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/concepts/concept-java-views.htm" target="_blank">the Java Views</a> and <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/concepts/concept-java-search.htm" target="_blank">search features</a> and master some of the <a href="http://rayfd.me/2007/05/20/10-eclipse-navigation-shortcuts-every-java-programmer-should-know/" target="_blank">top shortcuts</a>.</p>
