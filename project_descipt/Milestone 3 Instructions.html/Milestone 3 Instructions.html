<h1><strong>Milestone 3 Instruction version 1.0 28 October 2014<br /></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Recommend Completion Date</strong>: Before the end of classes.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In this milestone you will finish your game by developing a graphical user interface and integrating it with your Game Engine.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To provide an opportunity to gain additional experience and skills with:</p>
<ul>
<li>GUI Programming</li>
<li>GUI layouts and component hierarchies</li>
<li>The Observer design pattern</li>
<li>Use of sophisticated APIs.</li>
<li>Complete application development and deployment</li>
<li>Internationalization</li>
<li>Error recovery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Complete your project using Swing and realizing the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create all the user interface elements required to play multiple games.</li>
<li>Create the user interface elements required to save and restore your game.</li>
<li>Log the game events and errors to a log file.</li>
<li>Implement the GUI panels as observers of the game engine.</li>
<li>Try to avoid implementing your own concurrent code.</li>
<li>Implement the application within a single JFrame: the only additional windows should be modal dialog boxes.</li>
<li>Externalize all your strings.</li>
<li>Package your application as a self-executing jar file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important Notes and Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to get a basic (and possibly ugly) version of the application working before investing in beautification.</li>
<li>You can realize the learning objectives of this milestone with other GUI frameworks, like SWT or JavaFX. However, the final exam will involve Swing programming questions, so it's a good idea to practice this as well.</li>
<li>This milestone will require you to learn how to do specific programming tasks on your own, depending on how you want your GUI to look. However, remember that a lot of common UI programming tasks can be searched for in TaskNav.</li>
</ul>
